Olive, the other reindeer, 
was a little tiny dog. 
She helped Mr. Santa make it through 
the North Pole fog. 
She flew down on a piece of string, 
Comet put her there. 
And when the gumdrops began to fall... 
She helped Santa get them all. 
Now all the other, reindeer 
have a new doggie friend, 
Her name is Olive. 
And now the song must end.
