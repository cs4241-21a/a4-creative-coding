Far from the crowd
He's the day watchman
Walk past the trees
He used to swing from 

What bothers the spaceman?
The teeth in his head
I'm sure he could smile for us

Wave to the people
Out on the lawn
Mr. Ellis and Mr. Lee
Mr. Lee and me

What bothers the spaceman?
What's left for him now?
I'm sure he could smile for us

Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee (ley ley)
Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee (ley ley)
Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee Lee (ley ley ley)
