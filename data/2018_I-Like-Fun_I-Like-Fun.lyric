Impatiently I wait 
To refill my prescription
And count the tock 
Of the drugstore clock
A prototype they say 
To combat my affliction
Extra gravity to control me
But that's my fun 
And I like fun

And so do you
As we float away
So do you 
As we float away

My excellence at parkour
Is not to be discounted
As I leap away 
And disappear
My excellence at parkour 
Might be unexpected
At the age of 58 
It comes as quite a surprise

But not to you
We float away
Not to you 
As we float away
