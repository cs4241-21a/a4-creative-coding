I know what you're thinking
I can read your mind
In your thoughts it's obvious
You don't like me

From across a crowded room you can feel me staring
And you know that I can see how it is
There's so much pleasure to be had from mystery and secret plans
But you don't like me
'Cause I can read your mind

I can see the future
Like it's in the past
You will never be my friend
You don't like me

I know what you're thinking
I can read your mind
In your thoughts it's obvious
You don't like me

You like cigarettes, swimming laps, potato chips, Battleship, cats, and Court TV
You like shadow puppets, Woody Harrelson, reading in the bath, Nirvana, and baseball caps

You can hear me talking
Right up till I stop
When I do, I'm gone to you
But you are always there

I can hear the friendly words of advice that I'd be offered
If I had a friend to offer me advice
I'd be told to let it go and that I care too much
But this is not about me
And you don't want to know

I can see the future
Like it's in the past
You will never be my friend
You don't like me

You like Bollywood, snow machines, daguerreotypes, beauty contests, and cruise control
You like booster rockets, cutting with a fork, Terminator 2, the morning, and William Tell
