I think I'd like to call you Mom
'Cause you remind me of my mom
I'm gonna go put on my sailor suit
And we'll go out on the town

Why don't you let me call you that?
You're acting so much like my mom
She didn't like it when I called her name
You and her are the same

When we go out
You'll know someone is there
You will feel someone staring at you
You're on my mind
As I dream of the game
Where I'm rolling a hoop

And I turn around to find that you are gone
Which was exactly like my mom
And I will go hang up my sailor suit
And lie face-down on the lawn

When we go out
You'll know someone is there
You will feel someone staring at you
You're on my mind
As I dream of the game
Where I'm rolling a hoop

And I turn around to find that you are gone
Which was exactly like my mom
And I will go hang up my sailor suit
And lie face-down on the lawn

I see you moving towards the door
'Cause you don't trust me anymore
I need to find someone who's nice to me
The way that you used to be

And then I'm gonna call her You
'Cause she'll remind me of you
I'm gonna dress her in a sailor suit
That would look very cute

When we go out
She'll know someone is there
She will feel someone staring at her
She's on my mind
As I dream of the game
Where she's rolling a hoop

And she turns around to find that I am gone
Which was exactly like her mom
And she will go hang up her sailor suit
And lie face-down on the lawn
