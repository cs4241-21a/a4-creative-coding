We can't hear your car alarms
From our renovated barn
We can't hear your car alarms
From our renovated barn

We're tired of the pushy people tryin' to make it to the top
'Cause we got dreams of gravel roads and leavin' the doors unlocked

They say we can't make it in the country, 'cause our shit is too extreme
But we'll take the best of both worlds and forget the in-between

We can't hear your car alarms
From our renovated barn
We can't hear your car alarms
From our renovated barn

The new fast is going slow
The new high is living low

We can't hear your car alarms
From our renovated barn

Our lives are pretty killer
We're hangin' with the downtown crowd
Man, you know, our condo
Makes us feel so proud
Gritty heartage of the city
Keeps us on our toes
But we'll detox in the warm heart
Of our modest, weekend home

We can't hear your car alarms
From our renovated barn
We can't hear your car alarms
From our renovated barn

The new fast is going slow
The new high is living low

We can't hear your car alarms
From our renovated barn
