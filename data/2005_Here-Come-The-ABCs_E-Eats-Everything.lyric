A hardly has an appetite
And pokes at food too long
And B can barely bother
Because all the food is wrong
C likes only candy
And chocolate by the box
D is just disinterested
In anything you've got 

But E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything
E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything 

So toss it on a plastic plate
Or stick it with a fork
Serve it with a shovel
Or serve it on a spork 

Yeah, E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything 

F is far too fussy
And only eats with fancy wine
G eats only gourmet
But never can decide
H burns food so horrible
All I tastes is smoke
J just likes drinking juice
And K drinks only soda 

But E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything 

E is eating in a moving car
E is eating upside down
E is eating on a spaceship
E is eating off the ground
L and M and N and P
Won't start 'til O arrives
Q and R and S and T
Are wearing clothes much too tight
U and V and W
Are worn out from this song
And X and Y just will not share
And will not get along 

But E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything 

But look out now, here it comes
That final letter Z
Now Z's not like the other letters
Z's only eating Es
Yeah, Z eats Es
Yeah, Z eats Es
Z eats Es
Yeah, Z eats Es
