D, look at D
Half a circle, half a moon, an apple slice
There goes D, Captain D
My boy D, Commander D, the well-known D
D's getting on in years so he moves a little bit slower now
D is shy and doesn't get out of the house much anymore

And then there's W, here comes W
It's double wide, it cannot hide its pride, it's W
They call it W, there's that W
It thinks it's king, its all-time favorite thing is W

(Spoken):
D: W, you think you're so great.
W: Well, I am pretty big.
D: Yeah, you're okay.  You're just not as great as you think you are.
W: How come I never see you around anymore, D?
D: I got this big TV set at home now.  And I like to watch the sports.
