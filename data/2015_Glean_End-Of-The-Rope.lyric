How thoughtless of me
How dumb can you be?
Hopeless, wasn't that
What you called me and in fact
It was even more true than you knew

Where did the end of the rope go?
I forget now, did I let go?
After you left me hanging on your words
Which hung down like a rope
Where did the end of it go?
I'll never know

You're gone, but I'm still there
Clawing at the air
Now it's curtains for me
And I'll spend eternity
Doing joyless cartwheels in the void

Where did the end of the rope go?
I forget now, did I let go?
Long ago you left me hanging on your words
Which hung down like a rope from the sky
Where did the end of it go?
No one can ever know

Where did the end of the rope go?
I forget now, did I let go?
Once upon a time you left me hanging from your words
Which hung down in the ether like a rope from the sky
Wherever did the end of it go?
No one can ever know
