I'm so tired
Of your lies
And the evil things
You're doing behind my back

Are there crimes
That you have never committed?
I doubt it, sometimes I wonder
When will you die?

You're insane
You are bad
You wreck everything you touch
And you're a sociopath

But there's one thing
That everyone's wondering
When will you die?

Schoolchildren stay at home (yeah)
And all the banks will close (yeah)
Each year we'll mark the date (yeah)
On which we celebrate (yeaah)

I know how
I know why
I can picture every part
Of your comeuppance, except

For the one remaining
Piece of the puzzle
Which is when you'll die

This is Dan
And that's Dan
And there's Marty on the drums
To complete the band

And I'm John
And he is also John
And all of us are wondering
When you're gonna die

Still you live
You go on
But you're running out the clock
And if we knew how long

I'd be counting down the days
Until the lovely one
On which you're gone

On that promised morning
We will wake and greet the dawn
Knowing that your wicked life is over
And that we will carry on

We'll exhale
We'll high five
We will know at last
How great it is to be alive

We'll be lining up
And buying tickets
And then we'll be jumping
Up and down on your grave

You're insane
You are bad
You wreck everything you touch
And you're a sociopath

And the only way to mitigate
Would be to know the date
You're scheduled to vacate
When are you going to die?
Look me in the eye
Tell me when you'll die
