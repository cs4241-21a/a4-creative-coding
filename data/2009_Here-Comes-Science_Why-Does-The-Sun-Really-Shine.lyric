The sun is a miasma
Of incandescent plasma
The sun's not simply made out of gas
No, no, no
The sun is a quagmire
It's not made of fire
Forget what you've been told in the past

(Plasma!) Electrons are free
(Plasma!) A fourth state of matter
Not gas, not liquid, not solid
Ooh!

The sun is no red dwarf
I hope it never morphs
Into some supernova'd collapsed orb
Orb, orb, orb
The sun is a miasma
Of incandescent plasma
I forget what I was told by myself
Elf, elf, elf

(Plasma!) Electrons are free
(Plasma!) A fourth state of matter
Not gas, not liquid, not solid

(Plasma!) Forget that song
(Plasma!) They got it wrong
That thesis has been rendered invalid
