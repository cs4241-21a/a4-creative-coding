I am a man of honor
And I am mortified by your litany of slurs
Such a lot of words
Oh, dear

Madam, I challenge you to a duel
My second warned you to be careful
That bell can't be unrung
Madam, you mistake me for a bumpkin
It's clear you're yelling something
Oh please, don't burst a lung

You are an unfit rival
By spirits taught to sing
But a tune so twisted now
Like all that's sweet's gone sour
Oh, dear

Madam, you mistake me for a fool
Yes, your little dog may hold the pistols
Although he seems high-strung

Madam, I challenge you to a duel
My second warned you to be careful
That bell can't be unrung
Can't be unrung
Can't be unrung
