So here we are
Awake and dreaming
Oh don't look up, there's nothing there

Tilting at tilting things
Let's see what the daylight brings
Let's see what the daylight brings

Who needs diamond rings, picture frames, fancy things,
When paperbacks and radios tell the tale?

So nothing's fair
I'm worse for trying
While your eyes strain to see the air

Tilting at tilting things
Let's see what the daylight brings
Let's see what the daylight brings
