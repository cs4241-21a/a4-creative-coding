And thwarting my assassin
And while we’re laughing about it
I know you didn’t really do that
This was a test and you failed

Before you fire I should inform you
One of us is a double
I took the trouble to swap ties
Somebody taps you on the shoulder
You don't know who is your friend

Let’s all just take a deep breath
And slowly lower our weapons to the floor

I am alone in the three part folding mirror
On the bathroom door
I am alone in the three part folding mirror
On the bathroom door

Everyone take off your disguises
I see you and your brother
Dressed as each other this time
So now it appears the double crossers
Have been too clever by half

The fox has been outfoxed again
The row of smug expressions
All arrayed around are wiped away so

Let’s all just take a deep breath
And slowly lower our weapons to the floor

I am alone in the three part folding mirror
On the bathroom door
I am alone in the three part folding mirror
On the bathroom door
I'm by myself in the three part folding mirror
On the bathroom door
