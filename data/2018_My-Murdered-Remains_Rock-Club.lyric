We love all the people 
And we love to rock the house 
No one knows we're coming 
So no one's coming out 

To this particular rock club 
Have we played this club before? 
Y'see, I can't remember 
If we've played this club before

Put your hands together 
Get on your knees and pray 
Next time we come around here 
We won't be back this way 

Or to this particular rock club 
Is that really the P.A. 
Or just somebody's radio 
Left in the corner of the room?

"That one seemed good."
