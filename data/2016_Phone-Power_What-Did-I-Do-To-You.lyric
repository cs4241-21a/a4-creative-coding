Whatever happened to chopped off
Unloved, resentful appendages?
Will they be phoning us at 3 a.m.?
Whatever happened to them?

What is that distant scampering?
Have you secured the gates
And put out the lights?
Though my pounding heart nearly drowns it out
What is that scampering sound?

Someone's tampered with the storage unit lock
Someone's dragging something heavy down the block

Whatever happened to decency
To privacy, to false-bottom suitcases?
What is this angry world coming to?
What did I do to you?
