See them over there
See them moving down the road
Their arms held out ahead
And their eyes, their eyes are closed

Don't make any noise,
Cry out loud, or stamp your feet
You'll wake the girls and boys
Who are walking in their sleep

Every night they throw aside their blankets,
Swing their feet down,
Stand up, and move out to the street
Like they're under a spell
And together they roam across the country
And they're walking in their sleep

You'll recognize them when you see
Their rumpled hair and stocking feet
It seems like they want something
But we don't know what it is
But here they come again
Yes, here they come again

Move aside and let the people go by
They don't see you
Thinking that they're home in their beds
They must not be disturbed
When they're wandering all across the country
And they're walking in their sleep

Perhaps when they awake
They'll remember everything
They'll think it was a dream
It will be forgotten then

But don't make any noise,
Cry out loud, or stamp your feet
You'll wake the girls and boys
Who are walking in their sleep
