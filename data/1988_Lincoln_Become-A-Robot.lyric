Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Become a robot (clang clang)
Clang clang whoops, too late
Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Become a robot (clang clang)
Clang clang whoops, too late

Let's stick together 'cause we're number eight
Let's stick to numbers 'cause we're great

Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Become a robot (clang clang)
Clang clang whoops, too late

Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Harbor a deathwish (help help)
Help help help yourself
Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Harbor a deathwish (help help)
Help help help yourself

Hip hip horrific are the words we sing
Hip hip horrific is our thing

Here's hoping you don't (hoping you don't)
Become a robot (help help)
Help help help help help help help
