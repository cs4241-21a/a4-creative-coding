What's behind the door
Behind the piled up furniture?

Aaa!
Aaa!

Reach inside the wall and feel around
I think there's something there

Aaa!
Aaa!

Who's that hiding underneath the blanket?
Pull it off and see

Aaa!
Aaa!

Don't you think it's time
That we removed these bandages?

Aaa!
Aaa!

What's this button do?
I wonder what's inside this ticking
Package that's addressed to me?
How are sausages made
And what am I made of?

I'm gonna find out now

Aaa!
Aaa!
Aaa!

I'm gonna find out now

How's it going, baby?
Tell me, is there something on your mind?

Aaa!
Aaa!

Why'd you turn away?
Turn your head around so I can see

Aaa!
Aaa!

Why'd you hesitate?
What was the thing you were about to say?

Aaa!
Aaa!

Is there something else
That you haven't been telling me?

Aaa!
Aaa!

Is there any truth to the story
That I heard from this guy
That if you peel apart a golf ball
That deep inside
They put some alien blood?

I'm gonna find out now

Aaa!
Aaa!
Aaa!

I'm gonna find out now

What's this button do?
I wonder what's inside this ticking
Package that's addressed to me?
How are sausages made
And what am I made of?
I'm gonna find out now

Aaa!
Aaa!
Aaa!

I'm gonna find out now

Aaa!
Aaa!
Aaa!

I'm gonna find out now
