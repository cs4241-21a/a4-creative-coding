Outnumbered a million to one
All of the dicks in this dick town
Can't keep Johnny down
Men piled up in a towering mound
None of them once has found a way
To keep Johnny down

Spending days by myself
Remembering slights
I'm not a monument to justice
Plus which, I don't forget a face

And they can't (down, down, down)
Can't keep Johnny down (down, down, down)
They haven't yet built the man (down, down, down)
That'll keep old Johnny down (down, down, down)

Some dude
Hitting golf balls on the moon
Bathroom in his pants
And he thinks he's better than me
I'm pointing a finger at my own face
They can't know what's in here
And they can't keep Johnny down

Beneath my dignity 
To flip off the guy
When he pulls up alongside
To say my gas cap is unscrewed

And they can't (down, down, down)
Can't keep Johnny down (down, down, down)
They haven't yet built the man (down, down, down)
That'll keep old Johnny down (down, down, down)

And they don't (down, down, down)
Don't know what I've seen (down, down, down)
They can't know what's in here (down, down, down)
And they can't keep Johnny down (down, down, down)
