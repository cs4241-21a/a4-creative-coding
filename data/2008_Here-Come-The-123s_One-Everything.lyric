There's only one everything
Remember these words
There's only one everything
And if you go out and count up everything
It all adds up to one

There's only one everything
The last time I checked
There's only one everything
It kinda makes sense that there would only be
Just one, not ten, not three

If you get all the stuff together
And you have not left something out
Then could there still be anything left over?
I'm pretty sure that means there could not

We share the same omniverse
Please clean your room
We share the same omniverse
And even though you are over here and not there
There's just one everywhere

You got the cars, the trees, the house
There are some clouds, some birds, a monster
And when it's all too much to count up
You can put it in one pile

What if you drew a giant circle
What if it went around all there is
Then would there still be such a thing as an outside
And does that question even make any sense?

There's only one everything
The last time I checked
There's only one everything
It kinda makes sense that there would only be
Just one, not ten, not three
Not twelve

There's only one everything
Remember these words
There's only one everything
And if you go out and count up everything
It all adds up to one
It all adds up
It all adds up
It all adds up to one
