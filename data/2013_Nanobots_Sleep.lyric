Each (ahh)
Time (ahh)
I (ahh)
Sleep (ahh)
I'm (ahh)
Sad (ahh)
I (ahh)
Will be replaced by somebody else

In the morning
Exactly like me
Going around, drinking all my drinks
Kissing my wife
Thinking what I think
Making me resentful but

Each
Time
I
Get up in the morning I'm glad
I 
Took
Someone else's place
