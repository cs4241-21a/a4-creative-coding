Very Sad Sack is a sad bag
Very, very sad
Very Sad Sack

Withered Hope says she is his friend to the end,
But she doesn't like Very Sad Sack

Today Withered Hope saw the Very Sad Sack
And she tried not to meet his eyes
As he cut out a paper heart, pinned it to his arm
Told her everything he was holding in his head
This is what he said:

Withered Hope, I'm in love with you
Want to live with you, Withered Hope
Are you going to say to me this can never be?
Are you going to say to me, Withered Hope?

Sad Sack
Sad Sack

Withered Hope says she has a soul mate
Living in a city in another state
But the soul mate thinks about a picture in a book of a beautiful crook
But the picture in the book of the crook is in love with the brand new motorbike
But the motorbike doesn't like crooks,
It's in love with the Very Sad Sack

Sad Sack, I'm in love with you
Want to live with you, Sad Sack
Are you going to say to me this can never be?
Are you going to say to me, Sad Sack?

Sad Sack
Sad Sack
