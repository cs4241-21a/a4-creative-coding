They call me the greatest
'Cause I'm not very good
And they're being sarcastic
They're being sarcastic

Oh, I'm taking names
But I'm not doing much
With the names that I'm taking
G-O-A-T
They're being sarcastic
They're being sarcastic

They call me the greatest
But those cheers can be quiet
So I listen close
I listen close

Yes I'm taking notes
But those notes aren't helping
The ink washes away
G-O-A-T
It washes away
It washes away
