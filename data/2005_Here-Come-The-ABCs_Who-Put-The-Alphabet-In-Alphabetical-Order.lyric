All right!
Back in ancient times
You know that things then weren't that easy
So many different tribes
So many different ways of writing
So, who put the alphabet in alphabetical order?
I wonder
Who put the alphabet in alphabetical order?
Oh
Now I've got a question
With an answer that you might find easier
You've got to use your mind
To remember all the letters in order
Now, you put the alphabet in alphabetical order
Come on!
You put the alphabet in alphabetical order
We're going to put the alphabet in alphabetical order now
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y and Z
Now I know my ABCs
Next time won't you play with me?
Oh, I put the alphabet in alphabetical order
Yes, I put the alphabet in alphabetical order
I did it!
