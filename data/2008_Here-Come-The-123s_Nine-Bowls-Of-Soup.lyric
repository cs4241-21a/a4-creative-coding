Nine bowls of soup are balanced on the end
Of a rake on an ichthyosaur's head
Woah, woah, woah, woah!
Oh good, none of them spilled

Please can I have one Mr. Ichthyosaur?
No, you can't, I'm saving them for friends
But you don't have any friends
Yes, I do
No, you don't
Yes, I do. Now be quiet
I'm trying to concentrate

Nine bowls of soup on the wings of an airplane
Flown by an ichthyosaur
Woah, woah, woah!
Lucky thing they didn't all spill

Is there one that's kind of extra? Can I have it for my own?
No, you can't. I can't break up the set
But the soup is getting cold
No, it isn't
Yes, it is
No, I don't know what you're talking about

Nine bowls of soup are balanced on a snake
That the ichthyosaur is taking for a walk
Woah, woah, woah, waah!
Phew, I really thought that that was it

I just think that you have more than you can handle
What's all the soup for anyway?
I didn't think you even really liked soup
Why do you need nine bowls?
Why do you need
Why do you need nine?

If I tell you what these are for, then will you stop bothering me?
Nine bowls of soup
Arranged a certain way
Are some RADAR dishes
In a very large array
And the message they detect
From across the Milky Way
Says the aliens want to join us for lunch

I hope you guys like soup
