Can you find the hidden 'H'
Where it's hiding?
Is it on the ground
Or in the sky 
Or part of something here?
Does it fit somewhere inside?
Is there somewhere it can hide?

Can you find it?
Can you find it?
Can you find it?
There it is

Where's the secret 'R'?
Can you see it?
Is it in the train 
Or on the tracks 
Or at the station-house?
Is the 'R' inside the tree?
Where oh where can it be?

Can you find it?
Can you find it?
Can you find it?
There it is

Where is the 'L'?
Is it under the chair?
Is it growing in the hair?
Where could it be?
We have looked everywhere
And I'm sorry to say
That it's part of the 'H'
Which isn't fair

(Spoken)
W: Now where are you hiding, D?
D: Oh, you're never going to find me.  But my question to you is, W, where are you hiding?
W: I have no idea.  I've been looking everywhere.

Where is the 'M'?
Is it invisible?
Or is that against the rules?
Where can it be?
Well, it's right in front of you
And I'll give you a clue
It's an upside-down 'W'

There are letters everywhere in this picture
There's a 'B', an 'F', a 'Z', an 'X', a 'P', an 'O', a 'Y'
There's a sideways letter 'Q'
The aforementioned 'W'

Can you find them?
Can you find them?
Can you find them?
Can you find them?
Can you find them?
Can you find them?
Can you find them?
Here they are
