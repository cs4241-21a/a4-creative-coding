He says he knows me
But I don't know that guy
He's waving at me
But he looks kind of mad

Some crazy bastard wants to hit me
He's waving me over so he can hit me
But I don't know that guy
And I'm not going over there
Some crazy bastard wants to hit me

How has it come to this pass?
How can I get to my car?
Climb in, turn the ignition
Pull onto the highway
Where I am free

Some crazy bastard wants to hit me
He's waving me over so he can hit me
And who the hell is he?
I can't believe this is happening
That crazy bastard wants to hit me
