Moths beat on the window pane
Telling me I'm not the same
Sounds of nothing, sounds of fear
Speak to me when no one's near

Come on Rat Patrol
I'm on Rat Patrol

Wilderness of mirrors shine
Floorboards creak or footsteps heard
Headlights turn into the drive
Then disappear into the night

I'm on Rat Patrol
Come on Rat Patrol

Yeah
Yeah
