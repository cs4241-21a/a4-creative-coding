No taxi could take you
No trains rolling by
No bicycle shop, no planes in the sky
Planes in the sky

Not a night spent in jail
Parrot on my arm
Not a man of the world, no patch on my eye
Patch on my eye

Dark and metric is my town
Every day and night
Just because you're floating
Doesn't mean you haven't drowned

No spoiler, no windscoop
No mag wheels in back
No hydraulic shocks, no privacy glass
Privacy glass

Dark and metric is my town
North, east, west, and south
Just because you're smiling
Doesn't mean you haven't drowned
