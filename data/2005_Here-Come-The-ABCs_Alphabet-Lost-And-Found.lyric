On this fateful day in the history of whenever, an epidemic of missing letters has swept the land. Whatever the cause, for the sake of future generations, in the limited time we have been permitted, these stories must be told.

There was an apple that lost his 'a'
There was a zebra that lost his 'z'
There was a chauffeur that left his 'auffeur' on the dashboard
Of the car that lost its 'r'
Well, the car had lost its 'r' in a pothole
On a street that lost its 'e'
When the garbage collector with a missing 'ector' swept it up
With a broom that lost its 'oom'

Where they gonna go without their letters?
How can they survive without their letters?
Where they gonna go to find their letters?
They're gonna have to get together

At the alphabet lost and found (alphabet lost and found) 
(Missing vowels to the left, please)
(I-N-G, anybody lose an ing?)
(More than two syllables to the emergency room)
At the alphabet lost and found (alphabet lost and found)
(Prefixes and suffixes, door number two)
(Slang words, you're in the wrong building)

There was a school that lost its 'cool'
When they tried to ring the bell that had no 'll'
With all the letters gone, the spelling bee was canceled
Science teachers had their hands full
English classes could not be complete

Where they gonna go without their letters?
How can they survive without their letters?
Where they gonna go to find their letters?
They're gonna have to get together
Where they gonna go without their letters?
How can they survive without their letters?
Where they gonna go to find their letters?
They're gonna have to get together
