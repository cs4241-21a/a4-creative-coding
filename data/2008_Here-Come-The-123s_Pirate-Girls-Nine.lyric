Listen children, hear this story
That will take you around the world:
In the belly of the vessels
Stowed away nine pirate girls

Nine Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)

One named Polly had a parrot
The second named Polly had a parrot, too
That's the part that is confusing
And they were identical twins

The third was Nancy, she was fancy
Walked around with a fake tattoo
And four through nine were all named Peggy
And each one only wore one shoe

Nine Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)

Legend grew about their daring
Never did they walk the plank
They all shared one golden earring
And the truth is they all stank

If you finished all your homework
Brushed your teeth, and done your chores
And it's not too past your bedtime
Then your folks might tell you more of the

Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
