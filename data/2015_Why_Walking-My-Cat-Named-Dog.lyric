Walking all around the town
Singing all the people down
Talking around, talking around

Me and my cat named Dog
We're walking high against the fog
Singing the song, singing the song

Happy, sad, and crazy wonder
Choking up my mind with perpetual dreaming

Drifting up and down the street (drifting up and down the street)
Searching for the sound of people (searching for the sound of people)
Swinging their feet, swinging their feet

Dog is a good old cat (Dog is a good old cat)
People, whatcha think of that? (People, what d'you think of that?)
That's where I'm at, that's where I'm at

Happy, sad, and crazy wonder
Choking up my mind with perpetual dreaming

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Dog is a good old cat (Dog is a good old cat)
People, whatcha think of that? (People, what d'you think of that?)
That's where I'm at, that's where I'm at, that's where I'm at
