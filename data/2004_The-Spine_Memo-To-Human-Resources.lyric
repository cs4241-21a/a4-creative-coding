I'll be in the back, and I don't need the help
I'm good here in the back
I'm good all by myself
I'm busy taking stock of all the things that I've forgot (5 4 3 2)
And making mental notes of just exactly where I lost the plot (2 2 2 2)

I stuck around too long feeling sorry for myself
A disinvited guest rifles through the bathroom shelf
I'm searching for some disbelief that I can still suspend (5 4 3 2)
But never mind the furthermore; the plea is self-defense again (2 2 2 2)

Then the people came to talk me down
And I got some advice
Then the people came to talk me down
But I don't need advice; I'm down

Later in my car I considered what you said
I'm good here in my car
I'm good with what you said
And I'd be shouting out to you but I was mighty hoarse
Talk you through the finer points and issues much too small to force

Then the people came to talk me down
And I got some advice
Then the people came to talk me down
But I don't need advice; I'm down
