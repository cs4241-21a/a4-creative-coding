Omnicorn
Like no other creature ever born
On its head is every manner of horn
The omnicorn's the one
The one

Omnicorn
Omnicorn

Omnicorn
Hiding over by the edge of the pines
Now it's running past the hunting lodge sign
No one will see it go

I've been to museums
I've seen the no-see-ums
I know what I'm talking about

Omnicorn
Even rarer than a unicorn
It's got every single kind of horn
Omnicorn's the one
The one

Omnicorn
Omnicorn

Omnicorn
Leaping over someone's MÃ¶bius strip
Left behind from a vacationing trip
That's something to talk about
Omnicorn go
Omnicorn go
Omnicorn go
Omnicorn go
