Relaxing on my hands and knees
Relaxing on my face
Reclining in the bear trap of its tender, warm embrace
Glazed with coniferous green
Glazed with excitement and dread
Exhausted from oversleep
Awake but still in bed
Shaving razor's rusty but the sting brings you exactly back to

Maine
Is the world that went south
Maine
Is a punch in the mouth
Maine at the top of the chart
Has crushed my evil heart

Maine
Is the devil you know
Maine
Is the heaven below
Maine
At the top of the chart
Has crushed my evil heart

I love you anyway (I love you anyway)
I promise there's no other state (there's no other state)
But only if you stay away (but only if you leave)
And leave me to my ugly state (me to my ugly state)

And give me back my evil heart so I can see you as you aren't

Maine
Is the world that went south
Maine
Is a punch in the mouth
Maine 
At the top of the chart
Has crushed my evil heart

Maine
Is the poison you love
Maine
Is the hell from above
Maine
At the top of the chart
Has crushed my evil heart
