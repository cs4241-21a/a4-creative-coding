Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying
Of the bee of the bird of the moth
You can't walk, you can't ramble 'cause you're gonna have to scramble 
From the bee of the bird of the moth

Catbug is a cat, but he's got bugness in his veins
Manhouse lives within himself with thoughtful human brains
Neither one is equal to the challenge of the freak we'll call
The bee of the bird of the moth

Now the moth defeats the mouse and man
It's messing with the plan, it can't be believed
'Cause it's just a hummingbird moth
Who's acting like a bird that thinks it's a bee

Got a brand new shipment of electrical equipment
It's addressed to the bottom of the sea 
Send a tangerine-colored nuclear submarine
With a sticker that says STP

Windshield-wiper washer fluid spraying in the air
Head lice under hats lie in the headlights everywhere
Subatomic waves to the underwater caves
Of the bee of the bird of the moth

And the moth defeats the mouse and man
It's messing with the plan, it can't be believed
'Cause it's just a hummingbird moth
Who's acting like a bird that thinks it's a bee

Is it us or it that's messed up?

Everyone's deforming in the presence of the swarming
Of the bee of the bird of the moth
Protozoa, snakes, and horses have enlisted in the forces
Of the bee of the bird of the moth
All are irresistibly directed by the suction
Of a hypnotizing tractor beam presenting a production
Of the sleep of reason corporation in association
With the bee of the bird of the moth
