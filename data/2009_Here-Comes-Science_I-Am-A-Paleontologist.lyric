I love diggin' in the dirt
With just a pick and brush
Finding fossils is my aim
So I'm never in a rush
'Cause the treasures that I seek
Are rare and ancient things
Like Velociraptor's jaw
Or Archaeopteryx's wings

Now all the kids
Who wanna see 'em
Are lining up
At our museum

I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am

Could it be an herbivore
Crushing plants with rounded teeth
Or ferocious carnivore
Who moves so quickly on its feet?
It's like pieces of a puzzle
That I love to try and solve
It's so fun to think about
How a species has evolved

And all the kids
Who wanna see 'em
Can check 'em out
At our museum

I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am

Is it a T-rex? (I keep digging, digging, digging, digging)
(Digging, digging, digging, digging)
Maybe a Triceratops? (Digging, digging, digging, digging)
(Digging, digging, digging, digging)
Or a Carnotaur? (Digging, digging, digging, digging)
(Digging, digging, digging, digging)
(Digging, digging, digging, digging, diggin')
Pachycephalosaurus?

I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
I am a paleontologist
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
That's who I am, that's who I am, that's who I am
