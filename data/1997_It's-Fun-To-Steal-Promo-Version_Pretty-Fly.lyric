Once upon a time
There was a pretty fly
He had a pretty wife
This pretty fly
But one night
She flew away
Flew away

She had (two pretty children)
But one night
These two pretty children
Flew away
Flew away
Into the sky
Into the moon 

Once upon a time
There was a pretty fly
He had a pretty wife
This pretty fly
But one night
She flew away
Flew away
