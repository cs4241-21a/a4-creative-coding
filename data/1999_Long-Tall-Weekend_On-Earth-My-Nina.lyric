Here's my song.

Her burden of things walking out
Her burden of things walking out
On earth my Nina
On earth my Nina
God forbid a vaguer feat
National hell mugged me
Say, the sparrow wants a morbid arrow
Here's a quarter, that's the one I won
Maybe I'll buy the whirlwind
That always keeps me yearning
Her sitter's down there mourning
Her burden of things walking out
Her burden of things walking out
On earth my Nina
On earth my Nina
