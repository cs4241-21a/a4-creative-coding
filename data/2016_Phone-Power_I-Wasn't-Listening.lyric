I wasn't missing it
I wasn't listening
I turned away
When I heard them say
It's Dial-A-Song

I always had my doubts
So I just tuned it out
I didn't know
Why they had to crow
About Dial-A-Song

My mind is a desert
And it's the horizon line
My soul was destroyed
Now it fills the void
The songs on that telephone line

I could be guessing wrong
But I'm still hanging on
I'm still on the ropes
Stuck on my hopes
For Dial-A-Song
