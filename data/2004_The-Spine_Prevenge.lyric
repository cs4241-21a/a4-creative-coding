Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge

At the freak show
In the front row
Mi amigo
Lost in the sound

Now you know that the girls are just making it up
Now you know that the boys are just pushing their luck
Now you know that my ride doesn't really exist
And my name's not really on that list

Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge

Fully moto
On the headfo
Rock the info 
The micro-type king

Calling Mr. Pupkin
To join us at the love-in
'Cause Pupkin comes alive
When prevenge is the plan
See Pupkin take the stand

Tired of waiting
Tired of watching
Negotiating
Parading around

Now you know that the girls are just making it up
Now you know that the boys are just pushing their luck
Now you know that my ride doesn't really exist
And my name's not really on that list

Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge

At the freak show
In the front row
Mi amigo
Lost in the sound

Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge
Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge
