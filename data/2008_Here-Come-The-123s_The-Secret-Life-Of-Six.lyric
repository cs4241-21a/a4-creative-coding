The secret life of six
Means having fun
When everyone's inside
He's in the sun

Six knows how to stand on his head
Six knows how to stand on his head
Six knows how to stand on his head
Six knows how to stand on his head

And when six pretends he's nine
He acts older and older
And when six pretends he's nine
He wears wiser disguises

The secret life of nine
Means having fun
When everyone's inside
He's in the sun

Nine knows how to stand on his head
Nine knows how to stand on his head
Nine knows how to stand on his head
Nine knows how to stand on his head

And when nine pretends he's six
He acts sunny and funny
And when nine pretends he's six
He announces he bounces
