I've got my house surrounded
I know I'm in there
Come out with both my hands up
And don't make me come in and get me
Don't make me come in and get me

I can't hide from my mind
Though I try, try, try
I can't hide from my mind
And you know why

Running against the traffic
To find where I lost you
I'm catching up to the echoes
And I hear your voice from the buildings
I hear your voice from the buildings

I can't hide from my mind
Though I try, try, try
I can't hide from my mind
And you know why

The bars are in my eyes
And kisses make you cry
Smiles turned out misleading
And memory's a lie

I've got my house surrounded
I know I'm in there
Come out with both my hands up
And don't make me come in and get me
Don't make me come in and get me
Don't make me come in and get me
