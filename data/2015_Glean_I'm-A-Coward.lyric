I'm a coward
It's a miracle I dare breathe
Overpowered by the gentlest summer breeze
Even when I close my eyes
I like to think that I'm hiding

I need a confidant
A co-conspirator
To turn the tide
On my losing side

I'm a coward
Guess I'd best make myself clear
I bet mumbles
Are what you'd expect to hear

I need a confidant
Who can see past my faults
And take the time
To save me from myself

I need a confidant
A co-conspirator
To turn the tide
On my losing side
