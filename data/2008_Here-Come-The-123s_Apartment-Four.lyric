I live up in apartment four
I'm on the very next floor
The number's right on the door
If you ever get bored
Come knock on my door
The one with the four

I live up in apartment number four
Where the sound of the drum comes from
Just follow the sound
That's where the four is found

You don't know me but I remember when you
Moved into flat number two
That was the day that I knew
That I was not the only one
Who might like the drum
That was shaking the floor
Of apartment four

Come on up to apartment number four
Where the noise of the drum comes from
Just follow the sound
That's where the four is found
