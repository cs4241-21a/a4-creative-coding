It just said something
Nobody heard it but me
I wasn't recording
Anyway why would I be?

It said something new 
That wouldn't come out of me
And I don't even dream about that kind of thing

That's not the insane part
The insane part is first of all it can't speak
Second of all the thing it said it's like it read my mind

It just read my mind
Now I have to lay down
Think things over
Everything up is down

It just said something
I was sleeping and then
I was awoken
I'll never sleep again

Excavate the book
Nobody needs to know why
Sell the delusion 
Look it in the eye

Speak it in reverse so the babies can see
Dress them in silver
Set the monkeys free

That's not the insane part
The insane part is first of all it can't speak
Second of all the thing it said it's like it read my mind

It just said something
I was sleeping and then
I was awoken
I'll never sleep again

(It just said something) it just read my mind
Now I have to lay down
Think things over
Everything up is down

(It just said something) it just said something
I was sleeping and then (set the monkeys free)
I was awoken
I'll never sleep again

(It just said something) it just read my mind
Now I have to lay down (set the monkeys free)
Think things over everything up is down

(It just said something) it just said something
I was sleeping and then (set the monkeys free)
I was awoken
I'll never sleep again

It just said something 
Set the monkeys free
