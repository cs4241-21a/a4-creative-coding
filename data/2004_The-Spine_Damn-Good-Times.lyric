I'm not much of a natural dancer
But I've got a friend who's a natural dancer
You could call her a jumpin' bean
She's got ants in her pants and she's gonna dance

I know a girl who's a jumpin' bean
She's got keys and a token when she hits the scene
Yeah I know a girl who's got a record machine
She acts like David Lee Roth when he turned 21

I know a girl who's a natural dancer
With a cape and a hat she's a natural dancer
She coughs and she laughs and she makes a lot of calls
And all of the people applaud

As she leaves the store
As she leaves the store (damn good times)
All of the people applaud (damn good times)

As she leaves the store
As she leaves the store (damn good times)
All of the people applaud (damn good times)

Can she do the karaoke? Yes she can, but she won't
'Cause she's highly qualified and she's not a joke
When it comes to opera, she is ossified
So all of you operas better step aside

When my friend got amnesia
She can't remember the show she saw
Like the one with the guy with amnesia
Who got off of the island on a helicopter

I know a girl who's a natural dancer
With a cape and a hat she's a natural dancer
She coughs and she laughs and she makes a lot of calls
And all of the people applaud

As she leaves the store
As she leaves the store (damn good times)
All of the people applaud (damn good times)

As she leaves the store
As she leaves the store (damn good times)
All of the people applaud (damn good times)
