Yeah
Your mom's alright
Your mom's alright 

Your ass is grass
And I'm a lawnmower
You dandelion
I am a sunflower

This darkest night
This veil of no hope
You piece of tape
Here comes a Post-It note

Yeah
Your mom's alright
Your mom's alright

Your ass is grass
And I'm a lawnmower
Incense and joss
I am a leaf-blower

Through scallions
I am the sour cream
Bring forth the froth
I am the hot steam 

Your mom's alright
Your mom's alright

Pop rock (bongos)
Pop rock (bongos)
Pop rock (bongos) 

Your ass is grass
Not least the east wing
Unfactual
Ungrease the beast thing

Some paper doll
Some super-fast car
Some onion roll
Some mayonnaise jar

Yeah 
Your mom's alright

Yeah
Your mom's alright

Yeah
Your mom's alright

Your mom's alright

Alright (yes!) (x32)
