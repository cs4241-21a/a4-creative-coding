Time stopped
When you said hello
When you left
The clock began to breathe again
Now all I do is think about
The puzzle that remains

Your name it is unpronounceable
Distorted and illegible
I never figured out what that was
If I couldn't then I doubt I ever will

Rewind the tape, review the blur
Never the same, but still obscure
Turn up the sound and hear the white noise
Zoom and enhance if that were even a

Real thing
Which it isn't
Stare at the static long enough you'll
Be hypnotized be hypnotized

Now I spend
My days and nights
Looking at
A depression on the sofa
And over time it flattens out
But I am still depressed

Your name it is unpronounceable
Distorted and illegible
I never figured out what that was
If I couldn't then I know I never will

Rewind the tape, review the blur
Never the same, but still obscure
Turn up the sound and hear the white noise
Stare at the static and be hypnotized

Found
Found your sound
Wound down and nearly drowned
Lying on the ground

Your name it is unpronounceable
Distorted and illegible
I never figured out what that was
If I couldn't then I know I never will

Rewind the tape, review the blur
Never the same, but still obscure
Turn up the sound and hear the white noise
Stare at the static and be hypnotized
