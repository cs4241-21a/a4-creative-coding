I can read anything (Read books! Yes books!)
I can read everything (Read books! Yes books!)
I can explore (Books!)
I can learn (Books!)
I can discover (Books!)
I can name (Books!)
I can read everything (Read books! Read books! Yes books! Yes books!)
I can read anything (Read books! Read books! Yes books! Yes books!)

When I go to the library
Those librarians all run to me
and when I walk past the silent sign
I think fine fine fine fine fine

I am so crazy for books
This is a maze filled with books
Books are the fuel to my dreams
Which fly so fast you can't see

Then I go back into my house
Check out the books that I checked out
So many things have just begun
This is fun fun fun fun fun

I am so crazy for books
My mind's a maze filled with books
Books are the fuel to my dreams
Which fly so fast you can't see

I can read anything (Read books! Yes books!)
I can read everything (Read books! Yes books!)
I can explore (Books!)
I can learn (Books!)
I can discover (Books!)
I can name (Books!)
I can read everything (Read books! Read books! Yes books! Yes books!)
I can read anything (Read books! Read books! Yes books! Yes books!)
