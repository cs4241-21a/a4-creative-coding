Tryptophane
I was wrong, it's an ordinary day
Tryptophane
It began, I was feeling like I am 
By the leg of the bird
And the special day observed
I was mad 'til I found 
There was more to go around
Tryptophane

All alone, I was wrong
And there's much more going on
In my vein, in my mind
In my chemistry I'd find

Tryptophane, I'm aware
Like the calm breeze in the air
Like a swan on the lake
I'm not calm, that's my mistake
Tryptophane
