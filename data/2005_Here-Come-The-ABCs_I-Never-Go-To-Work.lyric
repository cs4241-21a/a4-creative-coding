Oh no, no, I never go to work
Oh no, no, I never go to work
Oh no, no, I never go to work
Oh no, no, I never go to work

On Mondays, I never go to work
On Tuesdays, I stay at home
On Wednesdays, I never feel inclined
Work is the last thing on my mind

On Thursdays, it's a holiday!
And Fridays I detest
Oh it's much too late on a Saturday
And Sunday is the day of rest

Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet every day
Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet every day
Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet every day
Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet every day

Practice Monday
Practice Tuesday
Practice Wednesday

Practice Thursday
And Friday
And I practiced all night on Saturday
So on Sundays I played best

Oh no, no, I never go to work
Oh no, no, I never go to work
Oh no, no, I never go to work
Oh no, no, I never go to work

On Mondays, I never go to work
On Tuesdays, I stay at home
On Wednesdays, I never feel inclined
Work is the last thing on my mind

On Thursdays, it's a holiday!
And Fridays I detest
Oh it's much too late on a Saturday
And Sunday is the day of rest

It's the day of rest!
