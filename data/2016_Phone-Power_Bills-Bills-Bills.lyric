Taking me places I ain't never been
But now you're getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things you did no more
Slowly making me pay for things
Your money should be handling

And then you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and not fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
Ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week

You trifling, good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why don't I go and find another?
A baller, when times get hard and I need someone to help me out
Instead of a squirrel like you who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Now you've been maxing out my card
Gave me bad credit, buy me gifts with my own ends
Haven't paid the first bill
But instead you're running to the mall
Going on shopping sprees
Perpetrating, telling your friends that you be balling

And then you use my cellphone (phone)
Calling whoever that you think's at home
And then when the bill comes
All of a sudden you be acting dumb
Don't know where none of these calls come from
When your momma's number's here more than once

Trifling, good for nothing type of brother (trifling)
Silly me, why don't I go and find another?
A baller, a man who's there when I need someone to help me out
Instead of a squirrel like you who don't know what a man's about

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So you and me are through

You trifling, good for nothing type of brother (good for nothing)
Silly me, why don't I go and find another? (another)
You trifling, good for nothing type of brother
Silly me, why don't I go and find another?
You trifling, good for nothing type of brother (good for nothing)
Silly me, why don't I go and find another? (another)
You trifling, good for nothing type of brother (trifling)
Silly me

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So you and me are through

Can you pay my bills?
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So you and me are through
