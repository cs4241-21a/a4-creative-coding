No is no
No is always no
If they say no, it means a thousand times
No!

No plus no equals no
All no's lead to
No no no!

Finger pointing, eyebrows low
Mouth in the shape of the letter "O"

Pardon me窶馬o!
Excuse me窶馬o!
May I stay?
Can I go?
No, no, no!

Do this窶馬o!
Don't do that窶馬o!
Sit, stay, roll over
No, no, no!

Finger pointing, eyebrows low
Mouth in the shape of the letter "O"
Red means stop; do not go
No
No
No!
