Paper out, pencils raised
One plus one is two
Two plus two is four
Four plus four is eight
And eight plus eight is sixteen

I can add, I can add
I can add, I can add

"I don't even know Spanish
But I'm gonna sing it in Spanish, now!"

Uno mas uno es dos
Dos mas dos son cuatro
Cuatro mas cuatro son ocho
Ocho mas ocho son dieciseis

I can add, I can add
I can add, I can add

Two kids countin' plus one kid countin'
Equals three kids countin'
Three kids countin' plus two kids countin'
Equals five kids countin'!

One plus one is two
Two plus two is four
Four plus four is eight
And eight plus eight is sixteen

I can add, I can add
I can add, I can add

"Alright, two plus one is three
Three plus one is four
And four plus one is five
I'm gettin' it!
I'm gettin' good at this!"
