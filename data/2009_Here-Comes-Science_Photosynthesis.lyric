Photosynthesis does not involve a camera
Or a synthesizer
Although that's interesting too
Photosynthesis is how plants take in light 
From the sun and turn it into energy
It's actually a thing on which most life depends
Here on the planet Earth

With plants

Chlorophyll cells take in carbon dioxide
Now that's the air that we breathe out
Combines it with water and exposes it to sunlight
And that's how plants can make their own food
Photosynthesis is why plants need light
And photosynthesis is why humans need plants
Because through photosynthesis plants make oxygen
And humans need oxygen to breathe
