Don't cross the street in the middle, in the middle,
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of the block

Don't cross the street in the middle, in the middle,
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of the block

Use your eyes to look up!
Use your ears to hear!
Walk up to the corner when the coast is clear
And wait
And wait
Until you see the light turn green

Don't cross the street in the middle, in the middle,
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of the block

Don't cross the street in the middle, in the middle,
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of the block

Don't cross the street in the middle, in the middle,
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of the block

Use your eyes to look up!
Use your ears to hear!
Walk up to the corner when the coast is clear
And wait
And wait
Until you see the light turn green

Don't cross the street in the middle, in the middle,
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of the block

Don't cross the street in the middle, in the middle,
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of the block
