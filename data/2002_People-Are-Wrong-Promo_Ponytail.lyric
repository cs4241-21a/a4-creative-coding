Let me tell you 'bout this thing
Grows out of the back of my head
It's not a clich√©, it's not laziness

Ponytail (ponytail)
Ponytail (ponytail)
Look at me! (ooh)
I'm a man with long hair
Ponytail (ponytail)
Ponytail (ponytail)
Look at me!
I'm a man with long hair (look at him with long hair)
Ponytail (ponytail)
Ponytail (ponytail)
Look at me! (ooh)
I'm a man with long hair
