4, 3, 2, 1, go!

We all like to play in the band, uh-huh
We all like to play in the band, uh-huh
But the drummer is the heart of the band
The drummer is the soul of the band
The drummer is the core of the band, uh-huh

Even when we're playing
If the drums aren't playing
It's just like the song is standing still
Even when we're playing
If the drums aren't playing
It's just like the song is standing still

4, 3, 2, 1, go!

Yes, we have guitar in the band
Yes, we have the bass in the band
But the drummer is the heart of the band
The drummer is the soul of the band
The drummer is the core of the band, uh-huh

Even when we're playing
If the drums aren't playing
It's just like the song is standing still
Even when we're playing
If the drums aren't playing
It's just like the song is standing still

4, 3, 2, 1, go!
