Gorillas in the jungle
Gazelles out in the field
Goats are in the barnyard
And gophers in their holes

Go go go go for G
Go go go go for G
You'll feel glorious, generous, gleeful and great
When you go go go go for G

Goofballs in their go-carts
Girl scouts chewing gum
Grandma with her gingerbread
And the drummer plays a gong

Go go go go for G
Go go go go for G
You'll feel gracious, gigantic, grateful and glad
When you go go go go for G

Grapes, glue, gyroscopes

Go go go go for G
Go go go go for G

You'll feel glorious, generous, gleeful and great
When you go go go go for G
