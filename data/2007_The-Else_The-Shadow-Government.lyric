Driving home from my meth lab
Realized something had changed
Looked in the sky
Saw with my eye
The moon was following me

Where's the shadow government when you need it?
Where's the shadow government?
It's a bad, bad world
It's a bad, bad world

Sifting through the confetti
I picked up my broken phone
Looked in the crack
Somebody waved back
Just sitting on their somebody throne

Where's the shadow government when you need it?
Where's the shadow government?
It's a bad, bad world
It's a bad, bad

[Cowering citizens:]          [The shadow government:]
Up the library steps
Up the library steps
Up the library steps
Up the library steps (Here comes)
Up the library steps (The Humvee)
Up the library steps (The Humvee)
Up the library steps

Crawling out of the flophouse
I saw the mayor stealing my junk
I doth protest, citizen's arrest
Now my body's in his trunk

Where's the shadow government when you need it?
Where's the shadow government?
It's a bad, bad world
It's a bad, bad world
It's a bad, bad
