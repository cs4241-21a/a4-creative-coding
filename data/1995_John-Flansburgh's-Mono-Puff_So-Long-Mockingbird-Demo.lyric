So long, mockingbird
Laughing on the telephone line
So long, mockingbird
Laughing on the telephone line 
I can read your mind
From half a mile
Peek into your mind
But I won't say

Hello, open field
I'm happy as a scarecrow now
Hello, open field
I'm happy as a scarecrow now

The cars can pass me by
But I don't mind
They can pass me by
I don't mind

So long, mockingbird
I won't miss your mockingbird face
So long, mockingbird
I won't miss your mockingbird face

I hate you so
