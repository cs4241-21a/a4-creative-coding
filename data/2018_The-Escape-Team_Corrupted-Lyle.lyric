Corrupted Lyle, from his head to his file
No one saw the system fail
And no one found a paper trail

Corrupted Lyle, his brain is a burning wreck
His name is destroyed and besmirched
His reign's been cut short to make way
For a byte-sized piece of style

Corrupted Lyle, alone all the while
He snuck into the Hall of Fame
And no one knew his proper name

Corrupted Lyle
