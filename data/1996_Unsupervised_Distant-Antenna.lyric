A remote broadcast tower outside New York City sends its message out into the area. Tonight they play a recorded performance of the group Mono Puff. Beyond the Orange Mountains west of the city, thin night clouds settle and the sun's rays can no longer hold back the interference from the distant antennas.

Against nature, a family labors to isolate the sound of Mono Puff from the static. Like so many others before them, they strain at the fine tuning knob of their receiver. Finally free, they hear and understand. This recording is dedicated to their struggle.
