Round, can you go around?
And if you can turn around without falling down
You can skate in a figure eight
If you can turn, if you can go straight

Turn left, go straight
Turn right, straight again
And then do it over
Repeat forever
That's all you need to know
That's the way you skate
In a figure eight

If you can grab a circle in your hands
And twist it, that's an eight

If it weren't for the Zamboni
You would never leave the ice
And I think I know the reason why
You never take a break
The sign that means forever
Is a sideways number eight

Turn left, go straight
Turn right, straight again
And then do it over
Repeat forever
That's all you need to know
That's the way you skate
In a figure eight

And if you twist the number zero
You will get the number eight

Turn left, go straight
Turn right, straight again
And then do it over
Repeat forever
That's all you need to know
That's the way you skate
In a figure eight

If you can grab a circle in your hands
And twist it, that's an eight
(If you can grab a circle in your hands
And twist it, that's an eight)

Twist the number zero
You will get the number eight
