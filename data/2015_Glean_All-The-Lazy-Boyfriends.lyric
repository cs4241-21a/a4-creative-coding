Begin again, begin again
Wake up the lazy boyfriends
Begin again, begin again
We can start at the end

Push your hands in your pockets, spaced out and sleepless
Put yourself on the docket, get ready to go
Got a brand-new day planner still snug in the wrapper
And the weekly to-do list as white as the snow

So who's good for nothing?
After you've run through your personal time
You've still got some Wite-Out
Enough to erase all the previous line

Did you say out loud that you think you've lost your edge?
Man, you never lost your edge
All the lazy boyfriends are preparing to change
They're standing in the kitchen and preparing to change
All the lazy boyfriends are preparing to change

This American splendor spreads out before you
From basements to attics, garages to sheds
Who needs a vacation? Who needs a direction?
Who needs motivation when you live in your head?

So who's good for nothing?
So hard to finish, there's nothing to force
You've still got some Wite-Out
And all of the girlfriends' buyer's remorse

Did you say out loud that you think you've lost your edge?
Man, you never lost your edge
All the lazy boyfriends are preparing to change
They're staring at the ceiling and preparing to change
All the lazy boyfriends are preparing

Begin again, begin again
Wake up the lazy boyfriends
Begin again, begin again
We can start at the end
