Lately I've taken to vacantly making repetitive movements 
Mistakenly seen as improvements
Nearing perfection but wisely electing to shun my reflection 
Preferring instead shoe inspection

Cheese and chalk do not talk 
But their eyes synchronize with a secret rhythm
Which is a way one could say that 
I love you for psychological reasons

Mumbling failure in jail my extremities flail and I wail 
Though my arms and my legs to the chair are nailed
Under the table unwilling unable the torture's medieval 
The dream is a fable with feeble wings

Why does the mouse share the house with the louse?
They won't say but they feel their feelings
Doesn't subtract from the fact that 
I love you for psychological reasons
Reasons I can't really go into now
Reasons we should probably not get into right now

I'm ashamed to admit I'm afraid of assuming the blame 
For my lame abnegation of braveness and fame
Brain in a jar in a car in reverse I'm rehearsing
The way I'll replay how to say how to be where you are

Flammable undiagrammable sentiments
Pass between animal beings
Hard to explain but it's plain that 
I love you for psychological reasons

Why does the mouse share the house with the louse? 
They won't say but they feel their feelings
Doesn't subtract from the fact that 
I love you for psychological reasons
Reasons I can't really go into now
Reasons we should probably not get into right now
