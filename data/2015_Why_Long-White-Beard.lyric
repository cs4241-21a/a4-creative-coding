Everything I say is true
And for your delight
I have such a tale for you
Can you stand the excitement?

I had a beautiful sleep
And I had some beautiful dreams
My family was there
And we laughed and we laughed
The alarm clock rang and I gasped

I woke up with a long white beard
A long white beard
A long white beard
Like Zeus on Mount Olympus
With a long white beard
And eyebrows most surprisingly long

Last night I walked in my sleep
And last night I talked while I dreamed
My grandma was there
And she gave me some cocoa
But when I awoke, it was loco

I woke up with a ten foot tail
A ten foot tail
A ten foot tail
And just like a sleepwalker
With a ten foot tail
Some collectables were knocked to the ground
