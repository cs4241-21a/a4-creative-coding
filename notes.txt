three.js

some sort of random generation of solids that respond to different frequencies of music
kind of like a visualiser type thing applied to a randomly generated terrain/randomly generated shapes
user options:
  enter the seed
  adjust frequency response (filtering the audio that gets passed to the visualiser?)
