Note that, although the project specifications request React or Svelte to be used as frameworks, this project uses VueJS. Instructor approval was received to used VueJS, a similar client-side frontend framework that effectively does the same things as React or Svelte.

This assignment was heavily based on A3; my submission for A3 (which itself was based on my submission for A2) already used VueJS as the frontend framework, so no code changes were required. I selected VueJS previously as it's very flexible, and easy to add to any web-based project; despite using a fully-fledged frontend framework, no build step is required, as VueJS is merely imported by CDN. Such behavior is possible because Vue can slot in to existing HTML, instead of requiring precompilation and formatting to/from JSX. I have been using VueJS in web projects and professionally since 2017, and it's my go-to framework for almost any webpage that involves manipulating the DOM with JavaScript. Reactive elements drastically speed up the rate at which I'm able to build out functional applications.

Were I to use a different framework, the development experience would likely be slowed. First, with most other modern frameworks, merely adding the full framework code by CDN is not possible, meaning that a build step is required, so the serverside code would need to be updated to handle a built path as well. React itself is described as an "HTML in JS" framework, whereas Vue is "JS in HTML", so switching to React would require not only learning JSX, but changing my key web development philosophy; it would probably be faster to just reimplement the desired functionality in vanilla JS. Svelte is syntactically much more similar to Vue (and there are actually a few identical operators), and thus I expect that a switch to Svelte would improve the development experience, despite the additional learning barrier to overcome.
