## Marvel API Data Visualizations

https://a4-hkyriacou.herokuapp.com/

My application used D3 to create data visualizations of the Marvel Comics API.

The four parameters a user can control are:
- Selecting Comic Data
- Selecting Character Data
- Selecting a first letter of Comic name on bar chart to view more information (Number of characters in comic. API returns 0 for character counts for most of them for some reason)
- Selecting a first letter of Character name on bar chart to view more information (Number of issues character appears in)

I faced some challenges getting the API to work right away, there were CORS erros and loading time erros I had to account for.
