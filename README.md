## Snake Game

your hosting link e.g. http://a4-charlieroberts.glitch.me

Created a web page to play snake online with the canvas API that allows 2d graphics for any modern browser. 
- Goal: implement snake with just plain javascript
- Challenges:
  - Working with the canvas api presented issues with floating point numbers 
  - Trying to minimize the number of redrawn components took some extra work
  - Ensuring that an apple would not spawn on the snake also required a separate data structure

Use WASD keys to move and get as many apples as possible!
