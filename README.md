## Goat Cheese

Link: https://a4-joseph-scheufele.glitch.me

This is an implementation of the famous snake game, but with a creative twist in that the snake is replaced with an ever growing line of hungry goats looking for a block of cheese. The arrow keys are used to move the goat herd around the screen. One challenge I faced was rendering the line of goats, I needed to find the correct size to make the images and the correct collision detection.
