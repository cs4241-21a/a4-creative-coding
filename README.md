Music Visualizer 

Winnie Ly

The goal of this project was to use various technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WebAudio) to create a webpage that the user can interact with. This project allows users to play a song from the Song List provided, change the color of the audio wave, and change the settings (play, pause, change the volume, loop, mute, and show the current song playing).

The challenges I faced when creating this project was setting up the audio visualizer as well as displaying it correctly on the canvas with the right parameters. 

The instructions on the screen should be self-explanatory as well as when redirected to the main screen as the user just chooses a song to play, adjust the color of the audio wave, and adjust the song with the settings menu (play, pause, change the volume, loop, or mute).
