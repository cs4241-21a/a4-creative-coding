## Online Drawing Pad

I have created an online simple drawing pad that lets the user draw on a canvas. They are given options for color, transparency, background color, and brush size. One of the big difficulties when creating the application was storing and using the cursor's current position relative to the canvas. While the actual storing wasn't too difficult, making the brush draw at the correct position on the cursor was more difficult than anticipated. To use, simply hold down a mouse button and drag the cursor along the canvas. It will use the color value stored in the Brush Color Picker and the Brush Size to draw a square of that size.
