# Goal
This website is a simple stress relieving drawing application. Users can draw whatever their heart desires with some options for customization to the tools.

# Accomplishments
- Created a simple Express server
- Utilized the Canvas framework
- User Interaction:
  - The option to pick between eight different colors
  - Increase/decrease brush size
  - The option to use the round, square, or butt brush
  - The ability to clear the entire drawing
- Includes basic instructions on the homepage and showcases controls on the canvas page
  

# Challenges
I struggled with the implementation of tweakpane. As an alternative, I thought it would be cool to utilize event listeners for things such as mouse and key clicks. 
This way, a user can have a variety of different controls to change the parameters of their brush.

I also had some trouble with Glitch throughout my work on this project such as trouble with CSS styling, the server displaying the correct page, and using Canvas, but I was able to get past these challenges with the help of office hours.
