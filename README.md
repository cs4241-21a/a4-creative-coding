## The Roll

- to play a very specific song with an audio visualizer in different colors and sizes with pause play ability
- there was supposed to be a boombox but the web audio api is like wizardry for me, so I couldn't tell what the scripts were doing so canvas manipulation is where we are 
- the audio visualizer doesn't show if either of the colors are not selected and the pause play requires an additional click on the first use and will not work if the visualizer is not working
- honestly this was much more stressful than I was advertised
