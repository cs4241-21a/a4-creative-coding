Audio Visualizer

hosting link e.g. https://a4-praisex.glitch.me/


the goal of this application was to use three.js to make an audio visualiser of a song. Three.js is very complicated so I ran into a lot of errors with syncing the audio up with the 3d object, as well as having tweakpane edit attributes of the object. Also once the audio was synced with the music there wasnt much I could do, so it only rotates.
