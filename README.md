## Pokemon Info

[https://a4-felchen.glitch.me/](https://a4-felchen.glitch.me/)

This application uses json data from the [Awesome JSON Datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/Awesome-JSON-Datasets). I used d3 for the visualization and added a tweakpane so the user can change which pokemon are displayed and also change the order in which they are displayed

Using the application should be pretty straighforwards. In the tweakpane there are checkboxes hidden under the folders "Type" and "Weaknesses" and to sort the pokemon, you also need to switch to the "Sort" tab.
