## Music Visualizer

This app can visualize the frequencies of the music.
I follow the instruction and recommandation in the project instruction.
The control panel is on the top right of the page.
The detail instruction is in the website.
The biggest challenge I face is extract the frequency data from the music by using Web Audio API.
