aacaira a4 assignment (d3.js/tweakpane)

## Goal

The goal of this project for me was to learn D3.JS and get comfortable poking around with it.

## Challenges

I had to learn D3.js which is known for being awful in it's own special way and there's a whole class at wpi for learning
it over seven weeks and here I am learning it in like three days lmao it awful.
i really tried on this one i just have a funeral tomorrow and i'm all over the place
there's no lables on the sunburst sorry and the buttons on tweakpane kept breaking my graph

## Sunburst

Users can interact with the sunburst settings via the tweakpane in the top right corner, so that's cool.

I also created my own JSON hiaracy so I could create a sunburst chart
