(Got an extension so this was submitted late)

My project is made with three.js and tweakpane. 

The goal of this project was to create some 3d cubes that the user can manipulate in various ways.

I was challenged in this project when doing some of the movements with the cubes, as this is my first time working
with any sort of 3d graphics.

**Baseline requirements**

Has a functional express server

I use three.js for my framwork

I use Tweakpane for my user interface interaction

**Tweakpane options**

--> numCubes - Controls the number of cubes

--> SpeedX and SpeedY - controls the speed of rotation for the X and Y axis

--> Change Color - randomly changes the color of the cubes

--> Cube Dance - the cubes move based on the inputs of SpeedX and SpeedY

--> Dont click this - Don't

Has some small documentation when the website is loaded
