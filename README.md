## First Gen Pokemon Types and Weaknesses

http://a4-evelyntrvn.glitch.me

This website is uses d3.js to display first generation of Pokemon and their types and weaknesses. Hovering over the bars will show a tooltip with the number of Pokemon in a given type. Clicking the bar will display the list of Pokemon of that type or Pokemon that are weak to that type. 

While creating the website, I had the most problem figuring out how to send the JSON data from the server to the client and get d3.js to be able to read the data. Once receiving the data, I needed to extract the data I wanted from the JSON. This also was a bit difficult because I was unsure of how I wanted to format my data, what d3.js would want to input, and how I should go about extracting it from the dataset. In addition to that, I had some difficulty with formatting the bar to create the horizontal bar graph rather than a vertical bar graph. The alignment and the positions of the bars and axes were a bit tricky to figure out what needed to go where but eventually I was able to create get the bars to where they needed to be.
