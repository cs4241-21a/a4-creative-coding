## LCD Soundsystem Visualizer

http://a4-kylewynnm.glitch.me

For this project I aimed to do a visualization of the album "This is Happening" by LCD Soundsystem.
This choice came from heavy enjoyment of the album, and the fact that I thought the synthy electronic
style of the band would provide for intriguing digital visualization.
  
One focus I had in this was making the website look as clean as possible, and I am proud of what I have
achieved. The sound waves burst out of the side flush with the edge of the page. The drawing of the sound
wave is designed so the negatives blend in with the background of the website. This makes it so the wave really
pops out on its own. The website has a clean and simple look, with the subject album popping out of the screen and
the tweakpane available to adjust anythying. I wanted the website to be thorough and thus it allows you to choose
any song off the album and see it visualized, you can restart a song, stop it, or start a new one with the dropdown
menu. You can also switch up the color of the sound wave. 
  I am very satisfied with the end result it checked almost all the boxes my initial goal had set out.
  
There are some challenges I faced while creating this project, but to be honest, simultaneously the project went
fairly smoothly.
- The project required learning canvas and the web audio API, but that was not hard to pick up especially with the lecture 9 material
- Learning tweakpane was a novel task, but a very easy one. Tweakpane ended up being very easy to use.
- I did have to call it quits on my attempted "Party Mode". This was an attempt to allow the user to choose two colors, and the wave
  would fade back and forth between those two colors as the song played. For the life of me I can't figure out what happened. Everything
  was set up nicely, everything tested well until I actually tried to assign the color value of the wave. Still unsure why, I plan on
  figuring that out soon. The code is all there just commented out, luckily it was just a cherry on top for the core of my project
