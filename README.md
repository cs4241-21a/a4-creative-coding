Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

The goal of the application was to create snake. One of the streamers I watch on Twitch will play this onstream when they are loading into a match to spice things up. Sometimes its scribble.io or snake.io. I wanted to create the original snake game. 
In the game of Snake, the player uses the arrow keys to move the snake around on screen. As the snake eats the food that appears on the board it will progressively get larger. The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the board or hits itself. At this time please refresh the page to start a new game! Thanks for playing!
  
Remember, ARROW KEYS! NOT WASD!
