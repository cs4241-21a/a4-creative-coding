Audio Visualizer 
http://a4-paloma-gonzalez.glitch.me

This application displays an audio visualizer to Phoebe Bridgers' cover of Teenage Dirtbag by Wheetus. In the user interface, users can control the colors, volume and font style of the visualizer. The main challenge I faced when designing this application was getting Tweakpane to work with the rest of my code, but once it was up and running, it was very simple to use.
